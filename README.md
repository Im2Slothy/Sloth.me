# Sloth.me
WIP - Sloth.me is a web-based URL shortening service that allows users to create shortened URLs for long links. The service is designed to be simple and user-friendly, with a sloth-themed design and easy-to-use interface.

# Key Features:

- Shorten URLs: Users can enter a long URL into the input box on the Sloth.me homepage and receive a shortened URL that redirects to the original link.
- Link Expiration: The shortened links will expire after a specified period, such as one month, to prevent outdated or broken links from being shared.
- Analytics: The service provides users with analytics and tracking features to monitor the performance of their shortened links, including the number of clicks and where those clicks are coming from.
- Simple Design: The service features a cute and playful design with a sloth logo, making it easy and enjoyable to use.
- Project Technologies: The Sloth.me URL shortener is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend design, along with PHP or another backend programming language for link generation and redirection. The service may also use a database to store the URLs and their corresponding shortened versions.

# Potential Future Enhancements:

- User Accounts: Users can create accounts to manage their shortened links and view more detailed analytics and statistics.
- Custom URLs: Users can create custom shortened URLs with personalized keywords or tags.
- Link Sharing: Users can share their shortened links directly to social media platforms or through email.
- Project Goals: The goal of the Sloth.me URL shortener is to provide a fun and easy-to-use service for anyone who needs to shorten long URLs. The service aims to be reliable, fast, and secure, with a focus on user privacy and data protection. By providing users with analytics and tracking features, the service can also help them optimize their online marketing and outreach efforts.
